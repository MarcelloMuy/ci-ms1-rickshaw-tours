# Rickshaw Guided Tours Project

## Introduction 
  Welcome to my first milestone project. This project is a website for a fictional guided tours company that uses rickshaw-style bikes and operates in Dublin, Ireland. This website gives the user a way to know the brand and book the service. It also shows the different attractions that are available to see in Dublin.

  A live website can be found [here](https://marcellomuy.github.io/ci-ms1-rickshaw-tours).

# 1. User experience (UX) design
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

  An online business presence, regardless of industry, can have a massive impact on its success. Nowadays some businesses still don’t realize that a big part of their customer base will visit their website before making a purchase. Having a website increases the credibility of your company and  it is a way to stand out from the others business that might be offering a similar service.

## 1.1 User Goals

## 1.3 Color Scheme
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

  Colors are the first thing people notice when they visit a website, and the color scheme can make a huge impact on both style and consistency.
   
  [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/) was used to decide the colors for this design.

  Here is an example of the color scheme that you can find in the website.

  ![color scheme](assets/images/color-scheme.png) 

  The following colors were used to design this website:
  * #4C8077 
  * #005B48
  * #FFA85C
  * #EEEAEA
  * rgba(211, 205, 205, 0.750)

## 4.1 Testing With Tools

### Chrome DevTools
  I used the developer tools to debug my code and to try different styles. When something in my code didn’t behave in the way that I expected, I would inspect it and try out different solutions. When I was happy with the results I would then copy and paste the code in the projects file.

### Responsive Tools
  I used [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) in conjunction with Chrome DevTools to check how the website behaved in different screen sizes.

### W3C Validator Tools 

 - I used [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) to check my code for any errors in the HTML pages.

    I had an error in my index page with a closing section tag that didn’t have an opening tag. I created an opening section tag to fix the error.

    I had an error in my bookings page with an empty section tag that didn’t have any elements inside. The section was deleted to fix the error.

    The screenshots of the validator showing no errors are below:
  
  Home page:

  ![Index page](./assets/images/index-w3c-validator.png) 

  Locations page:

  ![Locations page](./assets/images/locations-w3c-validator.png)
  
  Bookings page:

  ![Bookings page](./assets/images/bookings-w3c-validator.png)


  - I used [Jigsaw validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/) to check my code for any CSS errors. No errors were found.

  The screenshot of the validator showing no errors is below:

# 5. Bugs
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

### Solved Bugs
  - On larger screens hero image headings were difficult to read. Problem fixed by adding a box around them with a background color to improve contrast.
  - On Firefox list, icons were displaying text decoration. Problem fixed with using css style text-decoration: none. 
  - Images on locations page were too large on large screens. Problem fixed by adjusting width of images and using property float to accommodate them better on the page.
  - On Firefox form submit button was displaying too close to the textarea tag. Problem fixed by a adding css style padding-top to the button.
